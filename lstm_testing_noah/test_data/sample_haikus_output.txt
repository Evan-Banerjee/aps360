whisper bottoms in
crisp in desperation how
when time finds time

dewdrops at the mall time
contemplating a happier
sure its a good website

blossoms fall snowflakes
of orange and pink yellow
trees and red balloons

crimson red orange
flames of fire and cherries
table of contents

autumn leaves sit dry
with your limp awakening
little dismal year

snowflakes tumble long
fragrant sun bud dry earrings
praying the ice cream

sunset floats slowly
every apocalypse
bar without my pants

dawn mist arising
shadow rests in red crystals
arise quiet kind

rainfall through the roof
dancers from serenity
as his life goes by

shadows stretch houses
breathe lightly makes us wonder
the river floods show

waves deep within reach
dragons and butterflies sight
moon a dark sunset

frost of paradise
where redwoods king of piercing
lion in a song

midnight fills with lights
new adventures unexplored
still looms azure gold

golden light spirals
purple rose flower violet
blooms ripe hand sets razor

breeze swishes clearly
behind monitor claws victor
hugo

fireflies near the
ash laughing mighty riders
ready to fill soon

thunder was patience
this breaks when i went to bed
the sweet smell of ink

river flows wildly
air patches on the surface
dissipates in life

bamboo tiny peach
roasted leaves reds and corn fields
and salt in winter

winter chill moon cap
at night and the trees are warm
with no new branches

stone ravens applaud
ripping water into life
leaves as our pencils

tides like silhouette
the light sun reminds us will
relief dream there

bloom gives way to me
for i am not your hero
i am george carlin

crickets drops and wilt
famous inspiration poems
all fishing

evening mist the mud
and variable pain of
decision served

petals cascade through
warm air shuddering slip away
endless dewy dreams

summer rain splashes
vaguely to the season way
to join the earth line

clouds swirl point no scum
the limits of the raven
dont stop wondering

candle mask gravestones
i can be my little strange
but it is so smart

geese still has the best
old crow sways like moody shining
the breeze begs to walk

sunset everywhere
like the lilacs that happens
in my empty mind

voices closed in flight
reflecting contemplative
i live in the depths

snowfall is at night
with all traces of windows
living a fable

raindrops gently from
the ground and snow swept away
two worlds walk in mud

pine needles and brown
m trees think they grow below
they grow impatient

sands and scraps of and
the huddled in the frost boat
comes round and alone

leaves rustle below
up all the world for blessings
by is the spring sky

moonrise awareness regulatory
evolve plants residential
bookshelf

path that forever
melt among that one little
lifes wit of silence

shell have pulled me up
a heart dissolves by our
side past this rising

twilight and darkness
bright ornaments suddenly
a bride with purpose

dew chirping trails trees
the love is laced with passion
from our brightest

birdsong fills today
woman at the key lady
still the murky sea

buds blooming in my
azure window opposite
old mama feels late

whispers with ice dust
more historical than them
suffocating

branches wear forests
covered warm thick pelicans
thrown in the teeth bloom

storm clouds speak beauty
sheer beyond our window
it welcomes they wear

echoes from slumber
in the two and less we know
whose personal code

dragonfly inspires materials
publishing crime building races


thaw nevertheless
first i first stopped follows mat
focused and tidy

raindrops like ripple
as your arrows shakes to lit
life reflects the earth

silent hills the streets
welcome without each stories
hear somebody clear

morning sun rises
carefree spring lingers in breeze
clouds eclipse at noon

cherry bloom falling
off white lace the soil green buds
new autumnal month

mountain mist surrounds
clouds of sun shine deep brightly
my skin seeks charging

dreams fade and observe
others within us but more
give our eyes open

silver moon shadow
in the sky suit you soars at
reflected dark light

forest path with friends
softly eases slow beauty
dead melting to earth

golden fields gleaming
cherry green leaves bitter skin
soon on green cotton

nightfall in the sand
as all your friends and the leaves
and gray leaves fall sun

river stones cover
whatever light turns you n
long swim escapes

petals drift out now
senses are hauled for cool rain
lest fall to the ground

gentle stream recede
earthly spilling cloaked each hope
balance frees you peace

old oak branches sway
as a cat glides through a fog
northern a moment

rising sun to dream
into the pink pink and clouds
closed in my black coat

falling stars awake
separate all day long again
the real world began

spring rain sparkles through
dark as darkness surrounds us
into morning nights

wanderer roses
as opens as a lifestyle
therapy tools

snowfall our space
to be the essence of human
and healing and loss

echoing woods til
i wake grab raise the summer
searching for a duck

crimson leaves falling
as breezes as an image
raindrops of black skin

moonlight in the moon
with stars in cliffs falling to
his indifferent

soft breeze scent of snow
glimmers of hope are bright far
cold cool nights harbor

blue sky prevailing
like the spirits of the sun
the world goes before

lonely tree asleep
beautiful ghost colors magical
love hug

winter frost are cute
and new modern comic genius
order by surprise

pale dawn shining lit
as summer comes to change death
around the dune

shimmering lake mind
raising an art judy close
love is blooming in

sunrise island snow
falls inside the pink petals
sweet they never huddle

evening fog breezes
bow up across football skies
those pine boughs of grass

soft whispers of stone
create his passing low but
rather to die
