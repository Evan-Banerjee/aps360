You proud of yourself?
Get that ego stroked today?
Ego hear me now!

The worth of a word
depends on the living it
holds and that holds it

A single chestnut
inside a green mace still clings
to its limber branch

Fall light is itself
almost elegy, golden
with ripe remembrance

Windy rainy day
a blizzard of yellow leaves
hides white dog from me

early meetings and
late trains (boring I do know)
make for late haikus

song covering sucks
it doesn't suck but it's hard
mine sounds too midi

Some of those lost in
The depths did become monsters
Warped by vengeance lust.

The vanquished stick bug
And stung defender fell in
A grisly weird heap.

The speaker bent down
To peer closer. Curious
But wary of tricks.

We are so rooted.
We are rooted to the ground.
With entangled roots.

Opposed election
signs shout promises- they fall
on deaf jaded ears.

Lingering in bed,
blanket warmth, cat purring, I
miss orange sunrise.

Haikus can not die.
They will live on forever
'Til we stop posting.

Insults on deaf ears
My last three Haikus wasted
I should be nicer

So what you're saying
Is that Haiku is like prose
Just not very much

Awakened. Thunder
peels in the moist air. Lightning.
Startled sleeping cat.

Calm after the storm,
cloudy mediocrity.
The summer is gone.

He haunts, touches me
With cold fingertips of death
He lingers tonight

future steaming full ahead

The things that we say
can be repeated in time
as bad memories.

Right after the rain
the wait begins for sunshine
for roses to grow.

Eyes are a turnstile
that look and then look again
at what that is gone.

Flawless complexion,
framed by strands of cirrus clouds;
the spectrum of flames.

What does calm bestow?
The same as quiet offers?
Is it more? Or less?

Temporary scenes
are as seasons in the wind
that blow there and to.

The leaves of autumn
can often become delayed
as the weather speaks.

Limits on ourselves
are often but only fear
and not our limits.

If boredom arrives
it might make way for changes
found in your lifestyle.

Special memories
live and breathe as tomorrows
of which we wish for.

The rains of summer

Malady of vanity.
That makes men foolish.

While in a dreamland
what you see might become real

The weather changes
leaving portions of itself

The clearer the view
means the more you might worry.
Sometimes blind is best.

As many follow
there are those that are leading
heading the wrong way.

An old injury
Is acting up once again
Typing in wrist brace

Answers are hidden
in the questions that we ask
and answer ourselves.

Keep thine eye clear, lad,
Lest ye step where no man steps
Sans a curse to shout.

Scuttling before the wind like
Startled animals.

A jester with ambitions;
The end of the world.

To save his distressed Nanny;
Before Mom finds out!

And His heart is satisfied
Lo! His grace was bold!

dreading the distant voices
bringing me to day

If you were the third
would you feel inferior
to that bright red C?

I have learned the game.
If I don't grow up "worthy,"
Mom will take the blame.

Now the leaves throw shade
beneath they scorn the sun's loss.
Saved by plastic traits.

Boy, really felt blue
Two or three flying saucers
Parked under the stars

that made me leave here and stop
posting haiku here.

Hollywood monsters

Like what's up with that?!

Russian spam: it's gross.
Do not ask how they make it
or what is in it.

the sun was out and
world history kept going
but the sun was out

Life like a rain storm
Waiting for it to stop so
I can go outside

Strength and compassion
made me a challenge for you
you did not break me

The question is this:
of all that happens to you
what do you pass on?

The world too wanted
the fusion of sweet cigars
and white mouths, drifting

no need to do so!
But you, dear kids know it all
and Poe the Cat knows

Dude, She needs Haiku
Good coffee, Cunnilingus
Come on, make her smile.

Before work begins
I tip sand out of my shoes,
breathe fresh autumn air.

It's such a pity
To have wasted the weekend
With a pesky cold.

Is your project new?
Our themes will help it to thrive.
They are built for you.

Cleaning up my home,
And for the last time, I hope.
Slowly moving out?

My heart would finally heal.
He laughed as we danced

Baby Maple leaf
size of the tip of my thumb
green child gathering

This old yet new May
tread on some footprints on path
new thoughts old routine

Rhapsody in blue
Smear me up and down in poo
Let's go sniff some glue

bowed under burdens
eyes glued to the ground under
boughs burdened with birds

and maybe it will be real
this wonderful day

In the piles of wood,
a lizard was nipped by the
tail with a stinger.

My footsteps fall hard.
Each sodden leaf in my path
Reminds me of loss.

If I pose like this
will you feed me lush tuna?
Friday means treats, girl!

Lilacs, we lose our
heads, exquisite perfume, we
sigh, frolic- spring sings.

Is that really me
So beautiful and so wise
A unique being

Always be yourself, always
Don't mind others moods

Winters Sunset Pause
Reduced to my Pride and Guilt
In the land of Oz

We were the last ones
Left on the dance floor to show
The fruits of long love.

Hoaxes, pranks, and lies:
All false, a few offensive.
Dwelling on the Net.

Tormented by time
as the seconds move quickly
gray hair might be seen.

After a rainstorm
you might see a bright rainbow,
but no pot of gold.

Tripping over stairs
Running weighed down by my books
No time for lockers.

i see way more dogs than cats
more cats are inside

Sun's scorching fingers
Dancing upon his bare back
Success guaranteed?

Petals drift in breeze,

Journeys open to Nature
Once upon a time

And his hatred is colder
Than desert climate.

I long for comfort
And someone to hold my hand
The peace I must find

Every seed dies
Every seed is reborn
Songs of life spring forth

She failed to absorb
Her amniotic fluid;
Choked on it for days.

keep your mind focused
the lotus blossom opens
its delicate leaves

Colorado, friend,
cradle me in your nature,
wrap me in your peace.

your arm on my thigh
a single leaf falls softly
from the pooling sky.

they want to go out
from kennel communities
but want right back in

I'll live on the road
in someone else's country.
I'll buy false papers

The rain will not stop
slugs march, leaving trails of snot
the day smells of frogs.

sun in hiding sky
gray days nurturing the earth
much needed growing.

Wings glide on salt air
skimming ocean spray; one drop
holds nature's secret

I am last in line-
the furthest away from you.
Can I touch your hand?

Did you flush the cache?
Flush the cache, flush it again!
Is it working now?

To see the suffering
I ask that you put aside
Material things

Child, just let him go.
Let him go off on his way
Open your fingers

Fresh green leaf turn red
The hot air turn slightly cold
Fall is coming soon

Every day provides
Fresh new opportunities
For making mistakes.

A Frame of Data
Tidy, Mine, Analyze It
Now You Have Meaning

Little hands are raised
In prayers that God may hear
to 'Keep my mom safe'

some memories wrapped
in grey sheets of thick old rain
are still strangely warm

How many times will
We be able to witness
A dragon hatching?

In the good old days
Cars ran poets down like dogs
Wrote rhymes with their blood.

We are moths and can
infest everything! We then
lay a zillion eggs.

As breath stretches limbs,
heavy memories trapped in
cells shed from my skin.

True knowledge of Pride
Admission of being wrong
Not easy, not safe

Tears well in my eyes
When I think of what we had
Now gone forever

Tramp stamped and belly
pierced. Sixteen? No, she's forty!
Taste is obsolete.

A night so ideal
Today is meant for us
Flawlessly surreal

Raiders say Goodbye
Their fan's sorrow has no cure
Left to die inside

Homemade treats are great,
As is poetry, so why
Not have two at once?

Words are redundant.
Listen to what goes unsaid.
Love will interpret.

Sharpness in his look
Sweeping along the river
Coat billowing by

Dr Hawking is an
authority on profound
subjects of science.

With impunity
They invade, destabilize
Clear cut tyranny

If this leaf were all
I could ever write about,
it would be enough.

Sitting by the road.
I asked him where he came from,
He said he didn't know.

An open window,
Outside darkness roams freely,
Go see for yourself.

I thought I'd move on
I knew I'd still be broken
But I'd be okay

No need for widgets
Just dial up my digits
You so need to cum

A lean bobcat stalks
low on the ground in silence
His prey unaware

Haiku night dinners.
Some nights we spoke in haiku
And *only* haiku

also if they were
they would be in rainforests
not the deep blue sea

how to fire lawyer
how to fire low fire clay
how to fire lawn guy

blue face smoking crack
brine a chicken for smoking
brine for fish smoking

May your heart beat strong
May your minds will be broken
By this heartfelt song
