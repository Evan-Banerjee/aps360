### Instructions

Make sure to add the ```test_data``` folder from the drive replace the existing ```test_data``` folder

Also, add a new folder called ```models``` and put ```haiku_model_final.pth``` in it

I have added these to the gitignore also because they are too large.

Be sure to add any training data or model checkpoints you make to the gitignore also because they probably won't get pushed due to size.
